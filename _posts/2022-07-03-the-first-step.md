As a self-taught future programmer, I know that making a game from scratch will be difficult. But nothing as difficult as starting a new blog. I've gone for research a lot just to learn how *this* works. And I know this may be very simple, just some highlights, some configuration, but the hard part was to decide which path I should take and that my ego doesn't let me use something that I don't understand. Should I use a template or should I make everything for myself?

I had to make a point here. I'm as new as everything. I've learned the basics of Python and HTML5/CSS and then I learn that Jerkyll exists and uses Ruby and the Gems and all that I've just learned to *understand* what is going on here. 

And I did it. I'm **filled with DETERMINATION**, as it says in Undertale. I'll make a videogame. But I should start little by little. My plan is to make little games and then keep improving them to the point where I'm satisfied. I will start with a simple RPG where you just have to kill a dragon, maybe level up in some areas, and that's it. Then I will add more stuff, ideas that I am considering. I've thought of the most basic form of game: a text-based game. But I'm settling the bar too low. I'll make it half text-based and half interactive. With "buttons" as an option, that way my testing area (literally just my girlfriend and maybe some friends) doesn't have too much difficulty with "playing it". OK, let's go, people who I don't know. The journy for the Arepa's videogame starts... **now**.
