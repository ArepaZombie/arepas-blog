# I'm starting a blog!

This blog will serve as a logbook for my journey through the vast and immense sea of investigation, and all of that just to... make a videogame.

Making videogames is my dream and I just started to learn how to code, so, for practice and learning purposes, I'll make a videogame from scratch and I'll document everything about it on this blog. So... enjoy the ride.

### Theme for the blog:

This blog was made with the Jerkyll theme [moving](https://github.com/huangyz0918/moving)
